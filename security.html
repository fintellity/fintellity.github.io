PCI DSS compliance – where relevant
PCI DSS compliance (Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard) is required of all service providers that store, process, or transmit cardholder data. The program applies to all payment channels, including face-to-face retail, mail and telephone order, and e-Commerce (online payments). Compliance with PCI DSS means compliance with the required program validation by independent assessors. The PCI DSS is a single approach to safeguarding sensitive data for all card brands.
The PCI Data Security Standard consists of twelve basic requirements and corresponding sub-requirements to protect against cardholder data exposure and compromise. These are summarised as follows:
•	Building and maintaining secure networks;
•	Protecting sensitive data;
•	Maintaining a vulnerability program by developing and maintaining secure systems and applications;
•	Implementing and managing strong access controls;
•	Regular monitoring and testing; and
  •	Maintaining information security policies.</body>
  
  <h2>Transaction security</h2>
<body>All transaction information passed between merchant sites and our systems is encrypted using industry best practice and certificates to ensure identity and non-repudiation. Cardholder information is never passed unencrypted and any messages sent to your servers from us are secure and tamper-proof via encryption technologies.</body>

  <h2>Encryption and Data storage</h2>
<body>Once on our systems, all sensitive data is secured using industry best practice standards and solutions.</body>
