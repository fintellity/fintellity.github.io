<h1>Introduction</h1>
<body>This website ("Website") is operated by Fintellity Limited and any of its group companies (together "Fintellity" or ”we” or "us") and we are committed to protecting and respecting your privacy.
This policy (together with our Terms of Use and any other documents referred to on it) sets out the basis on which any personal data we collect from you, or that you provide to us, will be processed by us. Please read the following carefully to understand our views and practices regarding your personal data and how we will treat it. By visiting www.ghostpaygroup.com you are accepting and consenting to the practices described in this policy.
For the purpose of data protection legislation, the data controller is Fintellity Limited, 2 Frederick Street, Kings Cross, London, WC1X 0ND.</body>

<h2>Personal and Non-personal information</h2>
<body>Personal information is information that can be used to uniquely identify a single person. We also collect non-personal information, or may anonymise personal information in order to make it non-personal. Non-personal information is information that will not allow a specific individual to be identified. We may collect, store, use, transfer and disclose non-personal information for any purpose; for example, the use of aggregated transactional information for commercial purposes.</body>

<h2>Information we collect from you</h2>
<body>We will collect and process the following data about you:
	Information you give us. This is information about you that you give us by filling in forms on our website www.ghostpaygroup.com (our site) or by corresponding with us by phone, e-mail or otherwise. This includes information you provide when you register to use our site, subscribe to our service(s), search for a product, and when you report a problem with our site. The information you give us may include your name, address, e-mail address and phone number, financial and credit card information, personal description and photograph. If you give us information on behalf of someone else, you confirm that you have given them the information set out in this notice and that they have given permission for us to use their information as set out in this notice.
	Information we collect about you. With regard to each of your visits to our site we will automatically collect the following information:
	technical information, including the Internet protocol (IP) address used to connect your computer to the Internet, your login information (if relevant), browser type and version, time zone setting, browser plug-in types and versions, operating system and platform;
	information about your visit, including the full Uniform Resource Locators (URL), clickstream to, through and from our site (including date and time), products you viewed or searched for, page response times, download errors, length of visits to certain pages, page interaction information (such as scrolling, clicks, and mouse-overs), methods used to browse away from the page, and any phone number used to call our customer service number.
	Information we receive from other sources. This is information we receive about you if you use any of the other websites we operate or the other services we provide. We are also working closely with third parties (including, for example, business partners, sub-contractors in technical, payment and delivery services, advertising networks, analytics providers, search information providers, credit reference agencies) and may receive information about you from them. In this case we will have informed you when we collected that data if we intend to share such data internally and combine it with data collected on this site. We will also have told you for what purpose we will share and combine your data. We are working closely with third parties (including, for example, business partners, sub-contractors in technical, payment and delivery services, advertising networks, analytics providers, search information providers, credit reference agencies). We will notify you when we receive information about you from them and the purposes for which we intend to use that information.</body>

<h2>Uses made of the information
What processing grounds do we rely on?</h2>
<body>We will only use your personal data when the law allows us to. Most commonly, we will use your personal data in the following circumstances:
	Where we need to perform the contract we are about to enter into or have entered into with you (for example, to provide you with any products and/or services which you have requested);
	Where it is necessary for our legitimate interests (or those of a third party) and your interests and fundamental rights do not override those interests (for example, undertaking analysis and research for the purposes of improving our website user experience); and
	Where we need to comply with a legal or regulatory obligation (for example, equal opportunities monitoring).
Please note that we may process your personal information without your knowledge or consent, where this is required or permitted by law. Generally we do not rely on consent as a legal basis for processing your personal data other than in relation to sending direct marketing communications to you via email. You have the right to withdraw consent to marketing at any time by contacting us.
We may process your personal data for more than one lawful ground depending on the specific purpose for which we are using your data. Please contact us by emailing <strong>info@ghostpaygroup.com</strong> if you need details about the specific legal ground we are relying on to process your personal data.</body>

<h2>We use information held about you in the following ways</h2>
<body>Information you give to us. We will use this information:

	to provide you, or permit selected third parties to provide you, with information about goods or services we feel may interest you. If you are an existing customer, we will only contact you by electronic means (e-mail or SMS) with information about goods and services similar to those which were the subject of a previous sale or negotiations of a sale to you. If you are a new customer, and where we permit selected third parties to use your data, we (or they) will contact you by electronic means only if you have consented to this.

	to improve our site to ensure that content is presented in the most effective manner for you and for your computer;

<h2>Disclosure of your information</h2>
<body>We may share your personal information with any member of our group, which means our subsidiaries, our ultimate holding company and its subsidiaries, as defined in section 1159 of the UK Companies Act 2006.

	analytics and search engine providers that assist us in the improvement and optimisation of our site;
	credit reference agencies for the purpose of assessing your credit score where this is a condition of us entering into a contract with you.</body>

	If  Fintellity or substantially all of its assets are acquired by a third party, in which case personal data held by it about its customers will be one of the transferred assets.
	If we are under a duty to disclose or share your personal data in order to comply with any legal obligation, or in order to enforce or apply our terms of use or terms and conditions of supply and other agreements; or to protect the rights, property, or safety of Fintellity Limited, our customers, or others.

<h2>Where we store your personal data</h2>
<body>The data that we collect from you may be transferred to, and stored at, a destination outside the European Economic Area ("EEA"). It may also be processed by staff operating outside the EEA who work for us or for one of our suppliers. Such staff may be engaged in, among other things, the fulfilment of your order, the processing of your payment details and the provision of support services.
